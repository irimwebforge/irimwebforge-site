# Project Context
Vocalis is a mobile language-learning application focused exclusively on listening and speaking.  
The goal is to enable real-time practice by connecting users in audio “rooms” where they can converse and improve their oral comprehension and expression.

# Key Features
1. **Authentication**  
   - Account creation & login (email/password; social login planned)

2. **Public Room Management**  
   - Create a room by specifying:  
     - Title and description
     - Spoken languages  
     - Mood (tone/ambiance)  
     - Levels of profiency

3. **Browse & Filter**  
   - View a list of all public rooms  
   - Filter by language, mood and levels of profiency

4. **Room Participation**  
   - Roles within each room:  
     - **Admin**: room creator; manages permissions and has the same permission like Talkers  
     - **Talkers**: can speak and listen  
     - **Spectators**: can only listen  
   - Spectators request “talker” permission; only the admin can approve or reject  
   - Admin can promote or demote talkers at any time

5. **User Profile**
